RELEASE NOTES
=============
Silicon Labs USBXpress Host SDK for USB bridge products for Windows

Package version: 6.7.6
Release date:    2018-11-12

This package is the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Silicon Labs
USBXpress and Classic USB bridge products.  It includes support for the
following products:

* CP2102N   (VCP UART)
* CP2102    (VCP UART)
* CP2104    (VCP UART)
* CP2105    (Dual VCP UART)
* CP2108    (Quad VCP UART)
* CP2110    (HID UART)
* CP2112    (HID I2C)
* CP2114    (USB Audio)
* CP2130    (USB SPI)
* CP2615    (USB Audio)

The SDK is intended for application developers using the above Silicon
Labs products.  The SDK provides interface libraries, header files,
documentation and examples.

This package does not contain the VCP driver or Direct Access
Driver (USBXpress driver).  These driver packages can be found in their own
installer packages, downloaded from the Silicon Labs web site.

All host software support for Silicon Labs classic and USBXpress USB bridge
devices has been combined into this single Software Development Kit.
This combined SDK package now replaces the individual, per-device installer
packages.

The SDK is organized according to device.  During installation you can
choose to install support for any or all of the devices.  Each device
directory contains the following subdirectories:

* Debug/Release - interface libraries and utility executables
* Documentation - Data sheets, application notes, user guides and misc.
* Examples - example programs using the interface libraries
* include - header files used for compiling programs against the libraries

OS VERSIONS
-----------
This package is supported on Windows 10, 8.1, 8, and 7.

INSTALLING
----------
1. Run the .msi installer file
2. Agree to the license agreement
3. Choose which products to install
4. Use the Browse button to choose the install location, or keep the default
5. Click Next, then Install to install the SDK

UNINSTALLING
------------
If you have the original .msi installer, re-run it and it will give you
an option to remove the package.

    RELEASE NOTES FOR 6.7.6 (2018-11-12)

Changes for manufacturing and config tools
==============================================================================
MCUSW-94     | Corrects a problem where the VID of the part was being          
             | overwritten when setting other configurable fields.             
MCUSW-114    | Changed the format of the smt-operation guide to PDF.           
MCUSW-115    | Removed unnecessary link commands for libslabhidtouart,         
             | libslabhidtosmbus, libslabhiddevice, and libslab_usb_spi from   
             | the makefile for cp210xsmt.                                     
MCUSW-121    | Mac/Linux smt binaries are now statically linked with Silicon   
             | Labs libraries.                                                 
MCUSW-150    | Resolved an issue whereby CP2615[smt,cfg].exe failed to start   
             | if Microsoft redistributable DLLs were not present on the       
             | machine.                                                        
MCUSW-295    | Fixed an issue where non-programable bits in the QuadPortConfig 
             | field of a CP2108 configuration file corresponding to the state 
             | of the suspend pin were being incorrectly compared during       
             | verification.                                                   
MCUSW-344    | Fixed a problem where the CP2615 utility cp2615smt did not      
             | correctly erase previous configuration when programming a new   
             | configuration.                                                  

Changes for CP210x Runtime library
==============================================================================
MCUSW-237    | CP210x Runtime library no longer needs/requires to also be      
             | linked to CP210x Manufacturing library, with the newly added    
             | "discovery" APIs CP210xRT_GetNumDevices(), CP210xRT_Open() and  
             | CP210xRT_Close().                                               

Changes for HID SmBus library
==============================================================================
MCUSW-203    | On Linux, libslabhidtosmbus and libslabhidtouart now have a     
             | dependency on libslabhiddevice so that your Linux apps no       
             | longer need to explicitly link to libslabhiddevice.             

Changes for HID UART library
==============================================================================
MCUSW-180    | Fix device indexing problem for CP2114 devices configured as    
             | OUT-only or IN-only (for which the HID interface is MI_02).     

Changes for CP210x Manufacturing library
==============================================================================
MCUSW-374    | GetFirmwareVersion() is now supported in the Manufacturing      
             | library for the CP2105 and CP2108.                              

Changes for Library language wrappers
==============================================================================
MCUSW-125    | Added the function HidSmbus_CancelIo to the HidtoSMBUS library  
             | on MacOS X.                                                     

Changes for SiUSBXp Direct Access Library
==============================================================================
MCUSW-179    | Reduce the timeout for the "Get Part Library version" command   
             | only, called in SI_Open() to 50milliseconds.  This means old    
             | firmware will experience this timeout.                          

Changes for Installer packages
==============================================================================
MCUSW-116    | Removed data sheets, data shorts, errata and user guide         
             | documents for deprecated VCP parts CP2101 and CP2103.           
MCUSW-117    | Added a QuickStart Guide and a User Guide for the CP2114.       
MCUSW-253    | Add "RCP App" customizer to USBXpress SDK package.              
MCUSW-286    | Add CP2114 customizer to host SDK package.                      
MCUSW-375    | Added HTML API documentation to Docs directory.                 
MCUSW-378    | MacOS - Removed 32 bit code from binaries.                      

Changes for Host side example code
==============================================================================
MCUSW-118    | Added header and library search paths to the libusb_example     
             | xcode project for the CP2130 in order to pick up libusb from    
             | the default location used by homebrew.                          
MCUSW-159    | Added an example program called MacGPIOExample to show how to   
             | use the GPIO pins on the Mac using the 5.x Mac VCP Driver.      
MCUSW-163    | Added the HidUartExample.tar.gz source package to the           
             | CP2110_4/Examples folder.                                       
MCUSW-233    | Added cp2130_libusb_writeread_example(). All example operations 
             | read the TransferPriority byte to determine endpoint            
             | assignments.                                                    

Changes for USB SPI library (CP2130)

             | SLAB_USB_SPI.DLL CP2130 interface library), which put the       
             | device into a Stall situation and subsequent API calls failed.  
MCUSW-126    | Fix a bug where a file descriptor had not been properly closed  
             | in CP213x_TransferWriteRead.                                    
MCUSW-128    | SLAB_USB_SPI.h is now a single file for Windows, Mac, and       
             | Linux.
